# Task 2

  # Adapt the code from one of the functions abover to create a new function called 'multiplier'.
  # The user should be able to input two numbers that are stored in variables. 
  # The function should multiply the two variables together and return the result to a variable in the main program.
  # The main program should ouput the variable containing the result returned from the function.
